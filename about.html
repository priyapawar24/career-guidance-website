  <h1>About Our Community Project</h1>
  <p style="margin-top:12px;">
    This Career Guidance Platform is developed as a Community Engagement Project
    (Consultancy Initiative) to support rural and semi-urban students in making
    informed career decisions after 10th and 12th.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top:12px;">
    Through this platform, we aim to provide simple explanations, career
    pathways, awareness about available opportunities, and confidence to
    students who lack proper guidance and exposure.
  </p>
